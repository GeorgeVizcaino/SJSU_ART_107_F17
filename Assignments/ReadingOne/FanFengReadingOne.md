When I was looking at the artwork on Rhizome Net Art Anthology, an artwork titled Samsung caught my attention. It is because the word Samsung is so familiar to me, it is more familiar than any other titles on Rhizome Net. As one of the biggest electronics company in the world, I can see lots different Samsung products in my every lift. Even I am not a fan of Samsung, I still use their product like Micro SD card. The artwork Samsung is made by an artist group Young-hae Chang Heavy Industries in 1999 with two artist Young-hae Chang and Marc Voge. Samsung is a flash animation video with lots different caps Monaco typeface tests, and the video is played with some jazz and bossa nova soundtracks. As a video artwork related to Samsung, the video doesn’t talk anything about this South Korean company or its products, the video is about the idea of Samsung. 

The flash video of Samsung gives me a very old school feeling, the whole screen of tests with the soundtracks reminds me the silent film in the early 20th century. The blue background of Samsung also reminds me the blue XXX in General Idea’s video work Shut the Fuck Up. This old school feeling makes the video of Samsung very brainwashing, the blue background the and soundtrack makes me in a half-dazed state, the tests change following the beats of the soundtrack and keep go into my mind. The beginning of tests talks about the end of our life, then it tells us Samsung is everything of our life. The word Samsung keep flashing on the screen most of the time, and it strengthens the effect of brainwashing. There a very interesting transition in the video, before the word Samsung keep flash up, the video told people to shut their eyes than turn the screen into the dark. It is like Samsung become everything in our life just after that little moment, our life was re birthed from the darkness. 

The video really reminds me a lot about the Samsung even doesn’t talk about anything about the company and the products. Only the word Samsung is using red color in the video, it gives me a cheap feeling when the red Samsung flash up in the blue screen, it is like the handmade store banner draw on the fluorescent paper. Around 1999, Samsung was selling cheap cell phone in many Asian countries, and I still remember there were lots of the fluorescent paper banners on the street and tells people how affordable Samsung cell phones are. Other than the visual, I the texts of this video will remind many South Korean people about Samsung, becomes Samsung really is everything of their life. Samsung is doing lots different business in South Korean, people are using Samsung’s electrical products, they are living in the house built by Samsung, they use the Samsung Hospital when they are sick. Samsung is supporting the South Korean economy.

Samsung is a Multinational Corporation, the artists in Young-hae Chang Heavy Industries also made this artwork very globalized, they made this flash video in many different languages. The benefit of digital artwork is they can change the contents easily. After 1999, they still keep updating different versions of Samsung, such as uses different typefaces, use different kinds of music for the soundtracks, and change the color style to meet the aesthetics at this time.
