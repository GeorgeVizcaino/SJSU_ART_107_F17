## - Communication Creates Conflict [[1]](https://anthology.rhizome.org/communication-creates-conflict)

In my opinion Bunting's approach with his Cybercafe project is to create a more versatile method of communication between random human beings through focusing on social structures. By taking words and messages from people in his net-based platform and having other people present them in the real world at metro stations holding signs, printed on flyers and postcards or even through calls on public telephones and fax machines, he interconnects all existing platforms of communicating as a social playground.

In another project called the Irate Radio, Bunting creates a communication channel for humans to openly exchange raw and unrestrained thoughts, feelings and ideas opposed to receiving content provided by the media and government which is corporate-controlled.

What makes me wonder is that how uncensored content can effect our everyday life. Basically, nowadays the internet is the main media for exchanging thoughts and social networking. In other words, it is a stage for our thoughts to go viral through our social media outlets. Without us noticing, the distinction line in between the online and real world is getting more blurry every day. Some things happen to find their way into the real world even though they were only purposed to stay online and vice versa.

Communication Creates Conflict somewhat reminded me of the *Hated in the Nation*[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hated_in_the_Nation_(Black_Mirror)) (S3E6) of the Netflix series Black Mirror, where a murder mystery is under investigation. The detectives try to solve the inexplicable deaths of people who were all the target of social media.

What concerns me most is these social structures built at the disposal of human beings, as beneficial as they can be, they can also harm people in ways they are unaware of. The fact that all our actions are followed by consequences is not otherworldly to me, but becoming victims of "internet trends" unknowingly carried out by random human beings is where I believe censored and controlled data can save lives.
