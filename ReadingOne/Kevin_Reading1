The piece I wanted to discuss is Victoria Vesna's "Bodies Incorporated" Where the artist created this text-based chat room where they can create their digital self. However the drawback here is that if people do so, they must sign away all rights of that character and have the user sign through and confirm a bunch of legal things. Specifically, she used a Virtual Reality Modeling Language where the user would create a 3D model/avatar of themselves based on gender, size, ages.

Having tested the site, it did give me a strong feeling of intenseness or seriousness of giving away my right. As an artpiece, it did invoke strong feelings towards the audience. It made me rethink about how I create my own online avatars through games and how I essentially created something only to have it be owned by a different corperation or business. When playing games that involves creating a character, we do tend to forget that we do not own the characters, we're only given the right to play as that character. After reading through the terms and condition of this program, I quickly closed the site/link because it intimidated me. It reminds me of the old days where consumers would get warnings of a product. 

This leads me to my next point where Vesna's point here is that she wants to convey a message and that message is that she wanted to make her audience understand and think about consumer culture vs our own identity. How does one value their own identity and how does one think about such things from a day to day business.

"One Thing is Certain - The Avatar Business is Booming" stated Victoria Vesna. This quote was interesting because I have never would have thought about digital avatars from a consumer point of view. Whenever I would create a digital character on games, I didn't think about creating characters as owning property. As time goes on, our lives are becoming more digitized. By this I mean that a lot of the things we do now can be essentially be done digitally. This means that Vesna's point on a digital consumer market using identity is exactly the crisis we face today. It relates back to net neutrality and how our data online has now essentially can become a weapon against us. Adding on top of that, our data and info has become our weakness. Digital avatar and ownership is one thing, but having others control, own, and manipulate our search and history data has some power over our own control.
