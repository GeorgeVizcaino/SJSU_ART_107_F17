&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Travelogues are always an interesting read in my opinion. It is very unique that World of Awe was told through a GUI. I do think it is the best way to get the audience immersed into its world building instead of traditional text. I was able to run the emulator but I had problems navigating around the site. Although I did not get the full experience on my computer, I did gain an idea of how the site works; plus, Rhizome did provide some images to what I was missing out on.  One question that came up was, what is digital culture? According to digitalculturist.com, 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Digital culture is the Internet, transhumanism, AI, cyber ethics, security, privacy, and policy. It is hacking, social engineering, and modern psychology. More contextually, digital culture is using social media as our main mode of interaction with others; sharing every moment of your life on the internet; the selfie phenomenon; the live streaming obsession; the anonymity provided by online communities; Apple Pay and Android Pay; wearable technology; the use of emoji to enhance communication; internet/cell phone addiction; the sharing/on-demand economy; cloud computing and storage; the internet of things.”

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our digital culture has grown exponentially over the years and it is jaw dropping to think about. The rise of social media, streamers, online entrepreneurs, etc.; all has an impact in how we go about our daily lives. As population increases and technology advances our connection to this digital culture would only expand. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kanarek mentioned in her interview that language became an important theme in her work. I am still unsure of how World of Awe relates to language. When I think of language I think of sounds, tones, and dialects. Kanarek is probably talking about communication specifically between the artwork and its audience through an amazing GUI.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also an interesting question that was brought up in the interview with Yael Kanaraek and that is, what happen to all our electronic garbage? It appears that the desolated terrain explored by the narrator in World of Awe could be a futuristic version of Silicon Valley. This got me thinking about where we dump our electronic waste as well as our electronic recycling services; the possibilities of having to shoot our trash into space due to limited landfills.  

Other questions: What happens when there are no more materials for the components inside our electronics? Will we ever run out?
