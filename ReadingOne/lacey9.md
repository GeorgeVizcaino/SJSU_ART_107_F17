Screenfull is a collaborative piece between Abe Linkoln and Jimpunk that was created on the platform Blogger. This week took place over the span of a year, but at the same time it still lives on to this day. Screenfull first started out at as a way for web artists collaborate and create a dialogue for the new web 2.0 by embeding quicktime videos into the browser, which was new at the time. By posting images, gifs, videos, and whatever else content they could think of. By doing this they were exploring the platform of Blogger while also trying to break it past its limits.

I found this work interesting because it was prior to social media, so Linkoln and Jimpunk created their own new platform for a social media page within a blogging platform. By doing this they created, to me it seems, a collaborative digital sketch book between artists. By scrolling though this sketchbook you get a sense of the what was going on in culture at that time. By using a maximalist style the page is flooded with videos, images, and comentary. Even though the page was created in 2004 you'd think it was created in the mid 90's, it makes you realize how much the web design style has progessed to a more minimalistic style. But at the same the the over stimuation of images and flashing screen remind of webpages today, specifically giphy and imgur.
