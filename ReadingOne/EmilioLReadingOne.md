Upon browing the Net Art Anthrology Screenfull jumped out at me and I just had to see what was going on.
I was not disapointed, as it is what it's title says it is. Yet I find the URL for screenfull to not do the website justice. 
When I first typed screenfull.net into my chrome browser I immediteality thought this should be called someting more like screenoverflow.net.
I am glad my chrome browser caught immediate download links and stopped them, as the website began to pour out as it attempted to escape my browser into my 
download folder. I wondered why did screenfull intrigue me 
so much as it really is as the anthology states it to be, which is a maximalist collage of web design. It then dawned on me, it was the internet, 
in all its "shitposting" and meme culture without the structure of standard user interfaces to hide its reflection of human expression.
I felt just as I had browsing it for hours as I have felt browsing reddit for hours. It made me wonder, what's next.

I could experience the new, safely. We are all people driven by primal instincts on a low level, and we see this manifest in our fear of change 
and uncertainty in our society. We get angry when an update drains battery life on our phones, we get scared to open a new door in a dark room,
we get happy when we recieve that taste of ice cream once in a while that never seems to change. Never change we try, adapt we must. 
As a advid user for reddit I find my ability to learn new things to be stripped from the fact I have a user accounts with subreddits I've 
chosen to subscribe to, and brands market products to me I will likely choose to buy. Yet Screenfull.net offers no such experience and yet
im enthralled to view it. It is reddit uncustomized. It is my curiosity. That is the lesson I've leanred from this piece, against my better
judgement that I will find nothing of substance, I still found myself browsing the site, because I can be curious. Some of the post on the blog type site 
had some good art pieces. Some post infact made me feel like, "oh, this is the place where dankmemes subreddit gets it content."
Yet other post, were just flat out art. They stood out beautifully in the collage. Flowing yet crashing with the contant around them 
the art I saw in some post blew me away for it's transparency of skill and time the artist held. I found myself wondering if that is perhaps
my ethos as an artist. I need to stand out, find my own style and I will flow and clash with others but I will be apart of the chaos.
Ask any cosmologist, or astro physicists if the universe has order and they will reply, it is chaotic. Maybe. Is the website like the Universe?
I think parrallels can be drawn, like how there are rules and the content is provided by life. What does that then mean for my role in the universe.
Like the artist on screenfull, there isnt any, you just do. It's up the artist to create their footprint and just be. Does that mean I have no purpose 
in the world excpet by my own hand, I think so. Why then are we so afraid of the unknown in the world. Is it not like scrolling in screenfull?
Perhaps I was wrong about change.
I think we are afraid of it, but curiosity seems to win everytime I have to choose to be bored or not. It is us and our curiosity in this sea that 
is the internet. It is me in my most curious form, a reddit without walls. My oppurtunity for evolution and creativity.
That, or I just like "shitpost".
